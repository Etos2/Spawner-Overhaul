# Spawner Overhaul

A simple server-side mod for buffing spawners. Makes them unbreakable, instead requiring an enchantment.
Curse of Empowering gives a simple 1 heart damage buff to you weapon, but applies buffs to enemies either via a weapon or by impacting your armor.
Allows overloading a spawner, either by mining it or by attacking it from afar with a bow or trident, causing it to spawn 4 waves in quick succession which ignores light level requirements.

Client requires resource pack if hosted on server, purely for the name of the enchantment.
