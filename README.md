# Spawner Overhaul

A simple server-side mod for buffing spawners. Makes them unbreakable from typical means, instead requiring an enchantment.
Curse of Empowering applies buffs to enemies either via a weapon or impacting your armor.
Allows overloading a spawner, causing it to spawn 4 waves of mobes ignoring light level requirements.

Client requires resource pack if hosted on server, purely for the name of the enchantment.
